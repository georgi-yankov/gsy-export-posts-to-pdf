1. Settings are available in `Settings` > `Export Posts to PDF`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I export content as well from posts? =

No, current version of the plugin doesn't allow it.

= Can I translate the admin page of the plugin and fields in the exported pdf as well? =

Yes, you can do it. Find the file `localization/gsy-export-posts-to-pdf-en_US.pot`
included in the plugin. By using that file and the program [Poedit](http://poedit.net/ "Gettext Translation Editor")
